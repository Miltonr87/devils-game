### About

Made with **ReactJS** as SPA and inspired by features from console games, Devils Games uses **API Content** and consumes a API information from [Rawg](https://rawg.io/apidocs) with **Axios**. The whole project is a part of a challenge and It was written using the technique of **Styled Components** for CSS-in-JS. 

### Getting Started

- Clone the repo (HTTP Protocol): ```git clone https://github.com/Miltonr87/devils-game.git```
- Using NPM or Yarn to install the React APP and run the project on your computer. 

### Required:

As you see, **Devils Game** runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), so before you can continue, please ensure that you have it installed with NPM or Yarn. Once you have Node installed, you will need the React (17.01) library. So, to start the project in your machine, open your terminal inside the Devils Game folder and type "NPM Install" or "Yarn Install".

### Additional packages
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (To capture the Rawg API information)
- [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) (Used to simplify CSS)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) (React Component Pattern to move between pages)
